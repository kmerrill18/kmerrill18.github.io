## Research Experience  

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology - CSAIL**  
*Cambridge, MA*  
ADVISOR: DR. KAREN SOLLINS  
September 2022 - June 2023  
**THESIS TITLE: “ZK-SIGSTORE: SYSTEM FOR ANONYMOUS CERTIFICATE-BASED SOFTWARE SIGNING”**  
*2024 CHARLES & JENNIFER JOHNSON COMPUTER SCIENCE MENG THESIS AWARD*  

- My research focused on software supply chain security, particularly concerning open-source software authenticity. My work developed a practical, easy-to-use, and easy-to-deploy system for convincing users a particular software package is trustworthy while protecting the privacy of open-source maintainers. This project involved applied cryptography work as well as system design and implementation.  
- Designed, implemented, and measured a proof-of-concept system for anonymous, certificate-based software signing using zk-SNARKs.  
- Developed novel application of cryptographic commitment technique (Pedersen commitments) to achieve desired privacy properties for software signing system more efficiently.  
- Implemented and measured Pedersen commitment system for efficient, deployable, anonymous, certificate-based software signing.  
- Developed and formalized state machine model of a package repository, useful for discussing package repository security.  
- Applied Merkle tree techniques to package repository setting for greater efficiency while maintaining desired consistency properties.  
- Published paper on the project at CCS 2023.  

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Research Laboratory of Electronics**  
*Cambridge, MA*  
ADVISOR: DR. MURIEL MÉDARD  
Summer 2021  
- Implemented SGRAND algorithm in C++ for universal soft network decoding  
- Simulated network noise and SGRAND decoding in software and measured SGRAND’s performance
