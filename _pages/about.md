I am interested in the application of cryptographic primitives and
protocols to practical and usable computer systems.

I will be starting my PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2025.

I previously studied at MIT (MEng 2023, BS 2022) where I was advised
by Dr. Karen Sollins. For my master's thesis, I developed
[*Speranza*](/files/speranza.pdf), a system for open-source software
authenticity that prioritizes maintainer privacy and practical
usability. This work resulted in a first-author paper at CCS 2023,
where I presented the research, and won the 2024 MIT Charles &
Jennifer Johnson Computer Science MEng Thesis Award.
