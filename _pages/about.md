I am interested in the application of cryptographic primitives and
protocols to practical and usable computer systems for societal good.

I am a PhD student in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department as of August 2025. I am advised by Dr. Sarah Scheffler.

I previously studied at MIT (MEng 2023, BS 2022) where I was advised
by Dr. Karen Sollins. For my master's thesis, I developed
[*Speranza*](/files/speranza.pdf), a system for open-source software
authenticity that prioritizes maintainer privacy and practical
usability. This work resulted in a first-author paper at CCS 2023,
where I presented the research, and won the 2024 MIT Charles &
Jennifer Johnson Computer Science MEng Thesis Award.
